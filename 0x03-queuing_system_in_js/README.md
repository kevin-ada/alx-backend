# Queuing System in JS
## Introduction
In this project, we will be implementing a queuing system in JavaScript. We will be using the `queue` data structure to implement the queuing system. We will be implementing the following operations:
- `enqueue`: Add an element to the queue
- `dequeue`: Remove an element from the queue
- `front`: Get the front element of the queue
- `rear`: Get the rear element of the queue
- `isEmpty`: Check if the queue is empty
- `printQueue`: Print the queue
- `size`: Get the size of the queue
- `clear`: Clear the queue
- `peek`: Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it
- `toArray`: Convert the queue to an array
- `toString`: Convert the queue to a string
- `contains`: Check if the queue contains a given element
